There's a lot of distinction these days between "religious moderation" and "religious extremism".  The former is good (or at least acceptable) and the latter not. I [wrote about why I don't buy this](http://nibrahim.net.in/journal/?p=65) some time ago and have since formed a different picture of how influential religion is in a persons life. 

Instead of a single axis graded from moderate to extremist, I think two axes characterises the situation better.  The horizontal axis is graded from *disinterested* to *passionate* and the vertical one from *ignorant* to *knowledgeable*. 

The horizontal axis measures the amount how knowledgeable the person is about the foundations of the religion.  The popular moderate to extreme axis clubs knowledge with over the top action. Anyone goes over the top with what he or she does is automatically classified as a knowledgeable person.  This is often not true.  In the case os Islam, which is my own faith, I know plenty of people who are passionate about doing things but have no idea what is religiously sanctioned and what is not.

The vertical axis measures how much interest the person has in actually practising the faith.  There are lots of people with an academic interest in religion who become pundits or armchair philosophers.  They often have a decent idea of the theoretical foundations of religion but are divorced from the spirit of the faith since they don't practise it.  This is something distinct from knowledge and needs to be measured separately.

Based on this, we have four "quadrants" which, I've found, capture all the people I've seen much more accurately.

1.  **Disinterested and ignorant - ** 
These are people who don't particularly care about the religion and don't know much about it either.  People who are lapsed in their faiths (as opposed to those who actively disown it) fall into this category. They usually don't have opinions and even if they do are not particularly serious about them. 

1.  **Passionate and ignorant - **
These are people who are extremely serious about their religion and want to do something but don't know what or how.  They usually get misguided by charismatic leaders who either have ulterior motives or are themselves misinformed. Their passion makes them quite noticeable but their actions are usually wrong simply because they don't know better. Most people who are characterised as "extremists" in popular discourse fall into this category.

1.  **Disinterested and knowledgeable - **
These are people who are commonly called "academicians".  They know the nuts and bolts of the religion fairly well but don't practise it. They have opinions about the religion but are often disconnected from the reality of it.  Religions are made to be lived rather than just idly studied and someone in this category is like someone who's read a few hundred "How to drive a car" book who has never touched a steering wheel but offers expert opinion on driving and its subtleties. 

1. **Passionate and knowledgeable - **
These are traditional "religous" people.  The kind of people hagiographers are interested in. These people can authoritatively speak for the religion since they have the theoretical knowledge to understand what to do as well as the practical experience obtained from application of the knowledge.  

It's probably possible to add facets to this and make even more fine grained distinctions but I think these are sufficient to capture the current state of affairs.  

In the Islamic context, I think the first category has people who are non practising Muslims.  The second contains the people who are often called extremists.  The third contains are the armchair philosophers and self appointed "experts" on the religion. The media often turn to them for commentary.  The final category has the genuine article.
