I've been involved with PyCon India since the first edition of the
conference in [2009](https://in.pycon.org/2009/). This year, I was invited to give the keynote
at the 2017 edition of the event in Delhi. This post is about some
personal experiences preparing the speech and making the slides. 

I think it's worth writing about because it was very different from
what I usually do and also because, I think, it was a genuine
improvement to my process of doing this. Some of the changes which I
made are, in my opinion, generally beneficial. A few people like Anand
mentioned that the preparation was visible in the talk so this is not
just my own opinion.

## The speech
I decided to speak on Mentoring. It was something that I'd been doing
for a while after I started [The Lycaeum](http://thelycaeum.in). I mentioned this on the
mailing list and it seemed like it would click.

Ordinarily, I make slides and then use them as talking points while
ad-libbing the talk on stage. This time, I decided to do it
differently. I've been talking at Toastmasters gatherings in Kozhikode
and recently went
through [Mortimer Adlers excellent book on speaking](https://www.amazon.in/How-Speak-Listen-Mortimer-Adler/dp/0684846470). It has a very
old school approach to speaking where you write out summaries and
things like that before you give the talk. I highly recommend it.

### Getting the content
The first task was to figure out what exactly to talk about.

I spent a week or so brainstorming the talk itself on small pieces of
paper. I've been making a habit of keeping a binder of loose sheets
which are numbered using a system similar to the [zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/)
system. I've found this better than a computer screen because I can
scribble, draw arrows and do things that are hard to do on a screen
and I've found it better than a notebook because you can write on
multiple sheets at the same time as well as rearrange them as per need
and logic. Bound paper sheets might not be sufficient for a topic and
might be wasteful for some. 

These are not filtered at all. I just jot down everything that occurs
to me on the topic (at any time of the day). There were repeated
points, quotes, ideas for certain slides, turns of phrase that I
thought were cool, jokes, examples, techniques which I could use for
effect etc. A smorgasbord of raw material if you will. It felt like
squeezing all the stuff I had relevant to the topic out of me. A
worthwhile technique. I didn't have to focus on organisation,
presentation or anything else. Just make sure that *everything* was
out on paper. This general thing about having a brain storming stage
for any project is a good take away from this exercise.

### Organisation of the content

The talk was split into 4 parts - Intro, What, Why and How. This split
was one of the ideas that occurred to be during brainstorming. I got a
ton of points from the above process. Here are two examples - Wisdom
is contextualising knowledge, "Those who can do, those who can't
teach". The next step was to structure them. I filtered out things
that were very similar and then grouped the rest under the four main
headings. Here's a picture of what that looked like. 





Then I classified them into one of the 4 sections that I thought they
fit into into. This gave me the overall content. The next step was to
break this down distill each of the groups into cogent subgroups
(thematically clustering them if you will) and that gave me my
slides. The themes they fell under became slide titles.
