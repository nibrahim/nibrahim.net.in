title: "Interactive fiction talk at BCB 11"
---

I gave a little talk at [BarCamp Bangalore on Interactive fiction](http://barcampbangalore.org/bcb/bcb11/interactive-fiction-z-machines-and-inform). Due to some personal commitments, I couldn't get the slides ready by the time I got there. Just as well since I arrived late and got a room which didn't have a projector. We ended up having a nice little chat in the cafeteria. I thought I'd summarise the talk here for people who are interested and who want to do things in the area. 

## History

The first computer games were academic toys inside MIT. [Spacewar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar!) is probably the canonical example. You can actually play it if you visit the [computer history museum](http://pdp-1.computerhistory.org/pdp-1/?f=theme&s=4&ss=3) in Mountain View. There was not much commercial activity around games in this period. 

Things changed a little in the 1970s
