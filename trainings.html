<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
I'm Noufal Ibrahim. I am a freelance consultant, software developer
and trainer based in Bangalore, Karnataka, India. I'm a long time
Python user and am proficient in a handful of other languages as
well. I was the chair and lead organiser of <a
href="http://in.pycon.org/2009">PyCon India 2009</a> and <a
href="http://in.pycon.org/2010">PyCon India 2010</a>.
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  I conduct trainings on the technologies I use and am familiar with to
teach what I've learnt to others who are interested and perfect my own
knowledge in these areas. This page gives an overall view of my
training philosophy as well as resources to stay uptodate regarding
the classes which I'm taking.
</p>

<h2>Content</h2>
<p>
  As a freelancer, I work on niche projects that force me to stretch
the limits of my knowledge and I try to do a good job. More often than
not, this forces me to dive into obscure corners of technologies that
I use. I remove proprietary information from these experiences and
distill them into courses for public consumption. These are not
rehashed material scraped off the net. They're my own experiences
recast as courses. I stay away from "Hello, world" examples and from
stuff that you can learn from tutorials on the net.
</p>
<p>
  I spend a considerable amount of time researching my material and
creating these courses (which is why they're not very frequent). All
the material is original and lovingly hand crafted.
</p>
<p>
  I structure the material with a good balance between theory and
hands on coding. These are not uni directional lectures which you are
forced to sit through.
</p>
<p>
 All courses come with spiral bound notes of the entire content. I'm a
 bit of stickler for languag and so I try to make my notes as
 technically accurate and detailed as possible. I will also help you
 out over email with the material <em>after</em> the course for a
 reasonable amount of time.
</p>

<h2>Target audience</h2>
<p>
  I'm passionate about programming and computers in general and like
the company of people who are.
</p>
<p> 
  If you're looking for "certifications" and other such accolades, I'm
 afraid I don't offer any of those. My intention is to transfer
 knowledge about interesting technologies to an interesting
 audience. 
</p>
<p>
  If you fall into this category (and you'll know if you do) keep an
  eye out for a course that might interest you and drop by.
