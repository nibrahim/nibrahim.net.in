<h2>Welcome</h2>
<div id="intro">
<p>
Welcome to my little space on the web. I'm an Indian by birth and hail
from Kerala (one of the southernmost states of the country).
</p>
<p>
I'm one of those "Computer professionals" you bump into in Bangalore
although my passions lie in different directions. I'm an avid Python
programmer and a somewhat active member of the Bangalore Python User
Group. I also take a more than average interest in the Emacs editor.
</p>
<p>
I'm a computer science and mathematics enthusiast. I'm a muslim by
birth and now by choice.
</p>
<p>
I take an interest in programming, poetry and calligraphy among other
things. I'm a reasonably avid reader and enjoy the company of people
who are passionate about a personal cause and strive to reach it.
</p>
<p>
I'm a freelance programmer and trainer. I specialise in infrastructure
work - development tools, test harnesses, build infrastructures etc. I
mostly code in Python but am comfortable with a handful of other
languages as well.
</p>
<p>
I also conduct corporate trainings on the technologies I use.
