<h2 class="sectiontitle">Extending Python using C</h2>
<div class="postcontent">

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This is a course targetted at programmers who are interested in
wrapping libraries as Python modules. It teaches the vanilla
Python/C-API as described in <a
href="http://docs.python.org/py3k/c-api/index.html">the reference
manual</a> using <a href="http://libcsv.sourceforge.net/">libcsv</a>
as an example. 
</p>
<p>
The aim is to allow programmers to wrap libraries so that they can be
driven from Python (either for testing or to use Python as a glue
language) and to familiarise people with the innards of the
interpreter so that their understanding of Python itself is improved.
</p>


<h2>Course content</h2>
<p>
The course will use Python v3.1.2 and will build up a pythonic wrapper
for libcsv from scratch in a test driven fashion. <a
href="http://codespeak.net/py/dist/test/">py.test</a> will be used to
run tests. The overall flow of the course will be to describe a
feature, write failing test for it, implement it and then discuss
things. The aim is to provide a well tested wrapper for the library. A
more detailed outline follows
<ul>
  <li>Introductions to Python extenions - Why, when and how</li>
  <li>Conventions while creating C extensions for Python (naming,
  layout etc.)</li>
  <li>Structure of a Python module written in C and description</li>
  <li>Test setup</li>
  <li>Wrapping libcsv
  <ul>
    <li>Importing and module data</li>
    <li>Handling data at the Python/C boundary </li>
    <li>Exception handling</li>
    <li>Custom types</li>
    <li>Making the wrapper behave like a Python object</li> 
    <li>Debugging (gdb and the Python interpreter)</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Packaging</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The entire course content and material are original and hand
crafted. This is not a rehashed tutorial from various sources on the
web.
</p>


<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>
All participants must come with a laptop to the course. There's going
to be quite a bit of coding to do so make sure that your tools of
choice are installed and ready on your machine.
</p>
<p>
The laptop should have the following software installed on it.
<ul>
  <li> <a
	   href="http://python.org/ftp/python/3.1.2/Python-3.1.2.tar.bz2">Python
  3.1.2 </a> along with headers and development libraries </li>
  <li> <a
	   href="http://bitbucket.org/brandon/virtualenv3">Virtualenv3</a></li>
  <li> <a href="http://codespeak.net/py/dist/test/">pylib</a></li>
  <li> <a
	   href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/libcsv/files/libcsv/libcsv-3.0.0/libcsv-3.0.0.tar.gz/download">libcsv</a></li>
  <li> <a href="http://www.themiddleclass.org/csv/house/2010">Sample
  CSV file</a></li>
</ul>
Detailed setup instructions will be posted here soon.
</p>
<p> 
The tutorial will be done on a Gnu/Linux platform and it would be best
if the participants used the same. 
</p>
<p> 
Registered participants can contact me before the training if they
need help with installation and setup so that we don't waste time at
the venue.
</p>
<p>
This is <em>not</em> an introductory Python course. Participants are
expected to be proficient with C and have atleast passing knowledge of
Python. Make sure you're well rested since there's going to be a lot
of content and much of it quite subtle.
</p>


<h2>Course materials</h2>
<p>
All participants will get a spiral bound copy of the course notes. 
</p>
<p>
There will be a "homework" exercise which I will accept for 2 or 3
weeks after the course is complete that I will offer comments on to
cement all the concepts taught firmly.
</p>

<h2>Class size and pricing</h2>
<p>
The class is priced at INR 12,000 per head. 
</p>
<p>
The class is restricted to a maximum of 18 participants.
</p>
<p>
In case of any unexpected event due to which the class has to be
cancelled or rescheduled, I will refund the entire amount to you.
</p>

<h2>Hints, allegations and things left unsaid</h2>
<p>
Lunch and tea will be provided to participants as part of the
course. Internet and power will also be provided. You will have to
arrange parking for yourself.
</p>
