<h2 class="sectiontitle">Version control using Git</h2>
<div class="postcontent">

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This is a course targetted at programmers who are interested in
using the <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git version control system</a>.
</p>
<p>
Git is reputed to be a system that's easier to learn "inside
out". This course quickly skims over the "common" version control
commands that most people are familiar with and then dives into the
repository and it's format to make the students aware of what goes on
beneath the hood so that they're comfortable using the system.
</p>
<p>
The course dives into daily use and gets more and more advanced as it
goes on. We will cover basic usage, architecture, the branching model
and some workflow concepts.
</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>
All participants must come with a laptop to the course. It's best to
have a GNU/Linux variant installed on it since git is a child of the
UNIX tradition.
</p>
<p>
The laptop should have the following software installed on it.
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> itself </li>
  <li> <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/577572-display-a-git-repository/">This</a> script will be used to inspect the repository so it would be useful if people had ruby, <a href="http://grit.rubyforge.org/">grit</a> and <a href="http://graphviz.org/">graphviz</a> installed on their machines. This is not compulsory though.</li>
</ul>
Detailed setup instructions will be posted here soon.
</p>
<p> 
The tutorial will be done on a Gnu/Linux platform and it would be best
if the participants used the same. 
</p>
<p> 
Registered participants can contact me before the training if they
need help with installation and setup so that we don't waste time at
the venue. My email address is <code>noufal at nibrahim dot net dot in</code>.
</p>
<p>
Participants are expected to be knowledgeable about the general ideas
of version control. Please contact me before the course if there are
things you want clarified about the pre requisites.
