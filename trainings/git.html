<h2 class="sectiontitle">A practical introduction to git</h2>
<div class="postcontent">

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This is a course targetted at programmers who are interested in
using the <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git version control system</a>.
</p>
<p>
Git is reputed to be a system that's easier to learn "inside
out". This course quickly skims over the "common" version control
commands that most people are familiar with and then dives into the
repository and it's format to make the students aware of what goes on
beneath the hood so that they're comfortable using the system.
</p>
<p>
The course dives into daily use and gets more and more advanced as it
goes on.
</p>

<h2>Course schedule</h2>
<p>
The course will be a two day event. The training will run from 930 to
1730 on both days. 
</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>
All participants must come with a laptop to the course. It's best to
have a GNU/Linux variant installed on it since git is a child of the
UNIX tradition.
</p>
<p>
The laptop should have the following software installed on it.
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> itself </li>
</ul>
Detailed setup instructions will be posted here soon.
</p>
<p> 
The tutorial will be done on a Gnu/Linux platform and it would be best
if the participants used the same. 
</p>
<p> 
Registered participants can contact me before the training if they
need help with installation and setup so that we don't waste time at
the venue.
</p>
<p>
Participants are expected to be knowledgeable about the general ideas
of version control. This is not a software engineering 101 course. 
</p>


<h2>Course materials</h2>
<p>
All participants will get a spiral bound copy of the course notes. 

The course slides are available <a
href="/presentations/git/index.html">over here</a>.
</p>

<h2>Hints, allegations and things left unsaid</h2>
<p>
Lunch and tea will be provided to participants as part of the
course. Internet and power will also be provided. You will have to
arrange parking for yourself. You will also have to bring your own
laptop to the training.
</p>
