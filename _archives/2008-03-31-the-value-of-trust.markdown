My father used to run a wholesale textile business back in the early 90s. Most of his suppliers where from Bangalore (who in turn procured their finished goods from up north). The purchases were often made on credit and documentation was not always complete. However, hundreds of thousands of rupees changed hands frequently. The merchants valued trustworthiness quite highly and once told my father that unlike in their faiths, Muslims were obliged by their religion to pay off debts before they die or if they die to make sure that arrangements are made before that to pay them off and because of this, they had no qualms about making large transactions with Muslims. They were sure that they'd get their money. 

The Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) was characterised by trustworthiness and truthfulness and even his enemies used to trust his judgement in financial matters. 
It really warms my heart to know that even in these times, there are people that can impress their honesty on others like this. Alhamdulillah. May Allah increase all of us in this virtue.
