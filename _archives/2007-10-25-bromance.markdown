Displays of affection between males is apparently so tinged with the possibility of it being an expression of homosexuality that there is a <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bromantic&defid=2484251">term</a> for it not being so. The traditional Muslim method of greeting (kissing on the cheeks and hugging) would become a form of Bromance then. I get to see it every Friday at my neighbourhood mosque. :)<em> - via <a href="http://masudblog.com/WordPress/?p=150">Mas'ud</a>.</em>
