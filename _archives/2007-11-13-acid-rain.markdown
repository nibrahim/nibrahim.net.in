<em>I had to squeeze out a few syllables to get this right. It could still use some work I suppose.</em>
<br />
Sulphur clouds of certain death,
looming o'er my childhood land.
For what sin has lady fate,
dealt us such a cruel hand?

Your fathers bled their poisons,
straight into my widespread heart.
While I swallowed all I could,
now my mercy falls apart. 

We are of a different time,
servants of a different place.
Shower us with your ancient love,
show to us your tender face.

My love for you was burnt away,
no more mercy will I give.
For ancient sins, I shall take,
from your children those that live.

My pleas are of no avail,
he prepares to spread his wings.
To turn my children into,
screaming blistered wretched things.

I close my eyes and feel the sting,
of fire mixed with human tears.
Shut my ears to screams and cries,
they've come true, my darkest fears.

Burning death on my blistered skin,
can no longer cause me pain.
Our lives haven been cru'lly claimed,
by this season of acid rain.
