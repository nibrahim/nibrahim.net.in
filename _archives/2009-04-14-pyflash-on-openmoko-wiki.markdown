An <a href="http://nibrahim.net.in/downloads/pyflash-0.1.tgz">old project</a> of mine which I used to learn verbal conjugations in Arabic has <a href="http://lists.openmoko.org/nabble.html#nabble-td2611726">caught the eye</a> of some Open Moko hackers. They've adapted it and are using it as a flashcard application on the mobile platform. Needless to say, I'm thrilled. :D

The project has been registered on <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyflash/">SF</a> and has a wiki page at <a href="http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Pyflash">http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Pyflash</a>.

So, if you're feeling jobless, feel free to download it and start off chanting فَعَلَ, فَعَلاَ, فَعَلوُا... etc.
