A couple of us python enthusiasts in Bangalore are hoping to organise and conduct a python conference in Bangalore in September. It's something I <em>really</em> want to see. 

If any of my readers (especially the ones in India) are interested in being part of this, please leave me a message. We hold regular meetings to keep track of the various aspects of the conference. If you are in any local mailing lists which have python enthusiasts, please forward this information to them so that we can all work together to make this happen.
