Google is close to releasing their new browser Chrome based on Webkit.

The treating tabs as processes idea is nice and would definitely improve browser behaviour. I remember reading about this before I heard about Chrome at <a href="http://bramcohen.livejournal.com/51080.html">Bram Cohen's blog</a>. I also remember thinking that it would be overkill to provide that kind of abstraction. Goes to show how much I know... <em>Sigh</em>

<b>Update:</b>Also, <a href="http://tapthehive.com/discuss/This_Post_Not_Made_In_Chrome_Google_s_EULA_Sucks">some sneakiness in the EULA</a>? I'm not a lawyer but either the analysis is wrong or the EULA is really draconian.
<b>Update 2:</b> <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/update-to-google-chromes-terms-of.html">Google has fixed this EULA problem</a>.
