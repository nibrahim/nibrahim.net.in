<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_Wager">Pascals wager</a> is an argument that's commonly bought up by religious apologists and it's rebutted by agnostics and atheists. I think that is a weak proposition to make and that the usual rebuttal made is also wrong.
<ol>
	<li>The wager essentially says that it's better to assume that God exists and go on with ones life rather than to assume he doesn't. This isn't real faith. It's opportunism. I could very well rephrase this to "I don't really believe in God but I'll just pretend that he exists since it's safer that way" which sounds like hypocrisy. Reminds me of one of the characters in the movie "The Mummy" who has a cross, a star of david and a calligraphic "Allah" all on his neck. When confronted by the mummy, he picks them out one by one and starts uttering prayers to get the mummy to flee. So it's a weak thing to to be touted by apologists.</li>
	<li>When the opposite party (atheists) say that it doesn't tell them anything about which faith to follow so it's useless, they ignore the fact that accepting it in this way has taken them from a position of disbelief (there is no God) to one of selection(Okay, there is a God but now I've got to figure out which religion is true). That brings with it a new set of considerations and thoughts which were till then unnecessary to their position.</li>
</ol>
I see both the proposition and it's rebuttal as hollow.
