The pirate bay has officially <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-trial-the-verdict-090417/">lost the case</a>. A pity. I just downloaded some abandonware from there last week. 

What's the single most compelling argument for piracy? Price? I don't think so. I pay for the games I play unless they're so old that it's impossible to get them. I think the most compelling argument is that if you have a cracked copy, the user experience is superior to having an official copy. Here's an example. I <em>bought</em> Bethesda Studios' excellent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_4">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion</a> and spent many an enjoyable hour playing it. It had a copy protection scheme which forced me to insert the original DVD when the game started. A minor annoyance and one which the 'pirate' wouldn't have but I suppose I can see their need to ensure validity of the copy. 

Well, after a couple of months of playing, the DVD shattered. Now, I couldn't play any more. I suppose I could contact their sales office or customer support to have a new DVD sent to me. I'd have to prove ownership by digging out some bill or something which I've lost etc. Suppose I had a pirated copy that didn't have all this copy protection, I could play it to my hearts content. None of this stuff would interfere with my experience. As it stands, I've been punished for actually paying and buying the game. The evil pirate on the other hand can still wander through the vast expanses of cyrodill unhindered by the shattered DVD.

Unless the manufacturers of commercial software wake up and offer a user experience that's worth the money their customers are paying, I don't think the piracy menace is going to go away.
