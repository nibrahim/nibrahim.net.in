One of the problems with TV and other media is that they sanitise the images of war and present only a simplistic picture. War games help to reinforce the ideas about 'surgical strikes' and other such euphemisms. Human suffering is completely erased. 

Thanks to the net though, this can and is changing. Al Jazeera have put footage of Israel's atrocities in Palestine up for download licensed under creative commons. The repository is available here - <a href='http://cc.aljazeera.net/'>http://cc.aljazeera.net/</a>. Please redistribute this. We need everyone to understand that this kind of brutality cannot be kept under the lid and to convey the true plight of the innocent Palestinians being slaughtered.
