<p>It's been a long time since I wrote one of <a href="http://nibrahim.net.in/poems">these</a> but here goes. </p>
<hr />
<p>
'twas a mundane moonless night,<br />
when I closed the shutters and dimmed the light.<br />
A sound I heard from somewhere near,<br />
a sound with meaning that inspired fear.<br />
<br />
On another night, I might have shrugged;<br />
pulled the sheets and pillows hugged.<br />
But this was not a creak in the hall,<br />
it was a summon, it was a call.<br />
<br />
With nervous fingers, I took the phone,<br />
acutely aware of my being alone.<br />
I called for help and my fear was dowsed<br />
with the clearing of mind, my curiosity aroused.<br />
<br />
I was healthy, I was young<br />
strong of hand and quick of tongue.<br />
If someone was in my house that night,<br />
I would face him and put up a fight.<br />
<br />
As the skies grew darker still,<br />
my courage grew and my head it fill'd.<br />
I resolved to face this eerie creak,<br />
rather than be a mouse so meek.<br />
<br />
With strong steps and focussed mind,<br />
I stepped out to the villain find.<br />
The halls were empty and the doors were shut,<br />
I smiled and turned back... but!<br />
<br />
A person seemed to summon me;<br />
Someone I couldn't hear nor I could see.<br />
I was drawn into the outer hall,<br />
by an unknown force with a strident call.<br />
<br />
With anothers will, this outer room<br />
was my place of standing soon.<br />
In it on a plush black chair,<br />
sat a man with skin so fair.<br />
<br />
I had never seen him before,<br />
and didn't want to see him anymore.<br />
with a frozen smile and dagger eyes,<br />
he looked at me, his gaze a vice<br />
<br />
"Who are you" ? I asked in vain,<br />
my courage had fled and my fear was plain<br />
Cordially, he smiled at me.<br />
A smile more cold than any frown could be.<br />
<br />
He raised a bony hand and shut his eyes.<br />
My fear was gone and I felt nice.<br />
A soothing balm, it engulfed me.<br />
and I understood, now I could see<br />
<br /><br />
'twas a mundane moonless night,<br />
when the officer stopped to take a bite.<br />
A message told him that he should,<br />
respond to a call, if he could.<br />
<br />
Arriving at the source of the call,<br />
he knocked the door and entered the hall.<br />
An empty house is what he saw.<br />
This tired and weary man of the law.<br />
<br />
He searched the rooms one by one<br />
till all but the last were fully done.<br />
On opening this final door,<br />
he saw a corpse stretched on the floor<br />
<br />
A young strong man in his dressing gown,<br />
on the floor lay with an ugly frown.<br />
He called his chief with what he saw,<br />
this shocked, stunned man of the law.<br />
<br /><br />
The body was moved and the doctor said,<br />
"A heart attack struck this man dead.<br />
A healthy man, no reason to die<br />
what a pitiful way to say goodbye".<br />
