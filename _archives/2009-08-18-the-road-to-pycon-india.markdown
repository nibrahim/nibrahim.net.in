The whole business of organising PyCon India has been quite educational to me. I plan to deliver a presentation on it at the conference. The details are at <a href="http://in.pycon.org/2009/talkfull/22/">http://in.pycon.org/2009/talkfull/22/</a>.

This is non technical and just elaborates my experience of getting there. We're on solid ground now thanks to the sponsors and the volunteers who are spending loads of their personal time and money for the event. But that's what it's supposed to be. A community event.

The event is small in scale and definitely not a FOSS.in but it's a start and I hope in the coming years will blossom into a rallying point for all things Pythonic in the entire subcontinent. 

I hope to see you all there.
