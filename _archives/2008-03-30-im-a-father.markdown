Alhamdulillah. As of 21 March 2008 (Rabiul Awwal 13th), I'm a father. 
Mother and daughter are both doing fine. 

<b>Update:</b> We've named the child <em>Nusaiba</em> after one of the Prophetic companions who fought at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Uhud">battle of Uhud</a>. 

In a obliquely related way, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=4553209">Islam has surpassed catholicism</a> as the worlds largest religion. :)
