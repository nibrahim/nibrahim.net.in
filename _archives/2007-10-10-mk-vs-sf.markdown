I'm an old time Mortal Kombat fan. The number of hours wasted playing that thing with Mridul back at college are countless. My brother (who's much better at fighting games than I am) is a Street Fighter fan. <br />
There's this chap who calls himself proxicide who's done some really nice MK vs. SF fight scenes. They consist of ripped sprites, some good music and a simple storyline. I think he's a bit of an SF fan himself since the SF characters always win. The <a href="http://www.asiafinest.com/multimedia/flash/mk-vs-sf.htm">first part (Ken vs. Raiden) is available here</a>. The <a href="http://www.asiafinest.com/multimedia/flash/mortal-kombat-vs-street-fighter.htm">second part featuring Ryu and Scorpion is available here</a>. The latest part <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69UvITuOhYI">featuring Akuma vs. Chameleon is available here</a> (part two is available as a response to the video). Enjoy.
