Without doubt, one of the most immersive and well written RPGs I've ever played in my life. I think I first got exposed to the series around 1992 or so. The atmosphere, excellent sounds, neat puzzles and great storyline simply took my breath away.

The game is an implementation of the Dungeons and Dragons RPG ruleset. I don't have any experience with the board game to verify this though. The first two episodes of the trilogy (Eye of the Beholder and Eye of the Beholder 2: Legend of Darkmoon) were created by Westwood studios. They were the gems of the pack. The third one (Assault on Myth Drannor) is something I haven't really played but my first impression is that it was attempt to squeeze as much as they could out of the franchise. It was created by Strategic Simulations, Inc. by themselves and was a disaster (if one can trust the reviews).

The game operates by allowing you to create a party of 4 people initially. The usual RPG fare (fighter, thief, cleric, mage or paladin) with attributes (strength, intelligence, wisdom etc.). In the first part, you are commissioned to find the nature of an evil that plagues the city of waterdeep and to destroy it if you are able. The game starts off with you entering the sewers and the mages who commissioned you seal the entrance trapping you in the labyrinth. The journey takes you into the lairs of the <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~stanislavs/games/eob1mons.htm">dwarves and kenkus</a> (humanoid bird like creatures). As you go deeper, elements of the conspiracy to destroy the city become evident and you finally reach the Beholder (an orb shaped floating creature with many eye stalks each of which can cast a spell) named Xanathar. Defeating him is impossible without a special wand made from the eyestalk of a beholder. Once you defeat him, you emerge victorious. The original ending was quite terrible though. It simply printed that you're successful and quit the game. The Amiga version fixed that as far as I know. Here are some screenshots from the intro.

The second part (Legend of Darkmoon) was superior to it's predecessor in terms of story and depth. There was also more <acronym title="Non playing character">NPC</acronym> interaction. The series starts off with a beautiful introductory sequence in which you're summoned from an evening at the local tavern by your friend the archmage Khelben Blackstaff Arunsun and are requested to investigate the disappearance of a scout he sent to a nearby castle called Darkmoon which he suspects houses evil clerics cooking something up. The music during the introduction is wonderfully done. If you want to listen to it, it's available here (<a id="p86" rel="attachment" title="eob2-intro.ogg" href="http://nibrahim.net.in/journal/?attachment_id=86">eob2-intro.ogg</a>). The game is a little more creepy and the maps are much more detailed but on the overall, not a big depature from the feel of the original. These are some introduction screenshots.

The in game view is a first person view with your party on the left and the field of vision on the right. Here are some examples.

The games are must haves for any RPG fan. I haven't really played EOB3 to review it but from the few hours I spent with it, it's painfully annoying. There are simply too many monsters to fight.
