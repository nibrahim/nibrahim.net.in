These days, you hear how Islamic states would enslave the infidels and subject them to disgraceful 'dhimmitude'. How we'd have public executions and other barbarisms. How all the glorious achievements of the 'west' would be discarded and how the wheels of civilisation would be turned back. 

Apparently, The 'father of economics' <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith">Adam Smith</a> thought differently. This is an extract from ‘History of Astronomy’, The Essays of Adam Smith (London, 1869)
<blockquote>
...the empire of the Caliphs seems to have been the first state under which the world enjoyed that degree of tranquility which the cultivation of the sciences requires. It was under the protection of those generous and magnificent princes, that the ancient philosophy and astronomy of the Greeks were restored and established in the East; that tranquility, which their mild, just and religious government diffused over their vast empire, revived the curiosity of mankind, to inquire into the connecting principles of nature.
</blockquote>
Of course, those were non-democratic dictatorships with hedonistic rulers who didn't care about the plight of the poor unwashed masses whom they ruled with an iron hand unlike the totally free and glorious societies in which we live today.
