<a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/190357">This</a> is heart warming. Just like the Mongol invaders who razed Baghdad but later converted to the religion of the oppressed. One quote especially stands out. 
<blockquote>With little prior exposure to religion, Holdbrooks was struck at Gitmo by the devotion detainees showed to their faith. "A lot of Americans have abandoned God, but even in this place, [the detainees] were determined to pray," he says.</blockquote>
The role of religion as a transformative power and it's ability to provide spiritual sustenance are undervalued in an age when secularism is "The Right Way" and religion is just a personal practice to be kept behind closed doors. It's adherents offer it as a wholesome way to actually exist and navigate oneself through the world.
