The Bangalore Python Users Group (Bangpypers) met on 21 Feb at Thought Works, Bangalore (Diamond District). It was a swell event.

I was looking forward to meeting <a href="http://baijum81.livejournal.com/">Baiju</a> and <a href="http://uthcode.sarovar.org/~senthil/">Senthil</a> but they couldn't come by due to other engagements. Perhaps next time. 

The details of what went on are <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/BangPypers/Meeting21Feb2009">here</a>. The meetings are going to be held monthly from now so anyone nearby who's interested can show up. The mailing list is at <a href="http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/bangpypers">http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/bangpypers</a>.
