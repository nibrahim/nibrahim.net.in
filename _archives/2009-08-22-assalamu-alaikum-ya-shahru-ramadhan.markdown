<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan">Ramadhan</a> is here finally. 
Everyone makes checklists for Ramadhan and here's mine
<ol>
<li>Stop missing Fajr</li>
<li>Finish a Khatm before the end</li>
<li>Stop skipping duas after the daily prayers</li>
<li>Increase sadaqah</li>
<li>Focus on intentions some more</li><li>
</li><li>Focus on reciting the Dalail Khayrat everyday</li>
<li>Do more Tauba</li>
</ol>

I've posted this the before but a reminder is valuable even to the best of us. 
<blockquote>Ibn Khuzaima reported on the authority of Salman al-Farisi that the Prophet (saaw) delivered a Khutbah on the last day of Sh'aban saying: "O people: You are about to enter the shadow of a great blessed month. A night therein is better than a thousand months. Allah (swt) made fasting during this month an obligation and encouraged people to perform extra prayers. during its nights. Seeking nearness to Allah (swt) through a good deed would be considered like performing an obligatory act of worship. In turn, performance of an obligatory act of worship during this month would be rewarded seventy times more than during any other month. It is the month of patience, and the reward for patience is Jannah. It is the month of comforting others, and the month during which believers would enjoy plentifulness. The Prophet (saaw) went on to say:" Make sure you frequently do four things, two of which would please your Lord and the other two are indispensable for your salvation in the Hereafter. As for the two things that would please your Lord, they are: testifying to the oneness of Allah (swt) and seeking repentance. And the other two are: asking Allah the favour of entering Jannah and seeking refuge in Him from the Hell Fire."

The Prophet said, "Whoever does not give up false statements (i.e. telling lies), and evil deeds, and speaking bad words to others, Allah is not in need of his leaving his food and drink (fasting)." Sahih Al-Bukhari Hadith 8.83, Narrated by Abu Huraira.
