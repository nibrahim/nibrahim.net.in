It took me the better part of two months to finish reading <a href="http://www.nealstephenson.com/anathem/">Neal Stephenson's latest offering - Anathem</a>. The chap who I borrowed the book from finished it overnight but he's been surprising me with his reading speed for a while now so I'm not totally shocked. ;)

Well, where do I start? The book is a (huge - 900 odd pages) minefield of philosophical and meta-scientific ideas. Stephenson has replicated much of western philosophy (particularly the parts explored by scientists and mathematicians) on the fictional planet of Arbre. It has a couple of appendices (sort of the like the special features on a DVD) which include a copy of the "The dictionary" that details all the non-earth terms and people used in the book (eg. Avout, Fraa etc.). There's also a couple of side discussions on themes like configuration space and the platonic universe. There's also an underlying theme of how the avout (philosophers, mathematicians and people who are literate and rational) and the saecular (who are aliterate and very much like the general public here on earth) are different in terms of attention span and outlook. 

The book was inspired in part (according to Stephenson) by the <a href="http://www.longnow.org/projects/clock/">Millennium clock being constructed by the Long Now Foundation </a> which is a mechanical clock being constructed to run continuously for 10000 years. The need for long term thinking is an important theme in the book although this is not explicitly mentioned. It's conveyed by contrasting the avout frame of mind with the saecular frame of mind.

I need to reread parts of the book to get a solid grip on the ideas presented. It's really not a dime novel that you read and throw away (which is why I bought a copy myself). Here are some of the things that I'm thinking about which were inspired by the book and by the activities of the Long Now Foundation. I'm a religious person and so that seeps into my feelings about the subjects. 

<ul>
<li> The Avout have a lot of <em>Aut</em>s which are ritual observations at various times and frequencies. One of them is called provener which is a daily observation where among other things, the great clock around of the monastery is wound. The avout anchor their lives around this. The planning of ones life around one or more time based rituals is something central to Islam (the 5 daily prayers). Apart from the spiritual angle, I have often felt the usefulness of phase locking one's daily routines with something invariant so that life moves ahead smoothly. </li>
<li> Attention span. Working in a software company where requirements change faster than one can keep up, it's refreshing to see a people who actually consider the long consequences of what they do. I think it's instructive to spend more time thinking (as opposed to 'doing' and 'speaking'). I'm trying it out right now. </li>
<li> <a href="http://blog.longnow.org/2008/09/02/neal-stephenson-and-the-10000-year-clock/">Stephenson's original ideas</a> which were sent to the Long Now foundation for their clock are quite interesting. The system of concentric spheres divide people into classes who are willing to sit and spend time on something and those who are stimulus starved. </li>
<li> The book rekindled my interest in Roger Penrose and his work. I read The Emperors New Mind back at college and have a yet unread (but signed) copy of it's sequel The Shadows of the Mind which I now have a reason to pick up. </li>
</ul>
I'm sure much more will be added to this list as I reread the interesting parts of the book again.

An excellent book and my favourite of Stephenson's books so far. It was worth every page and I highly recommend it. It's got a lot to brood on and the story is more than strong enough to keep you reading without getting bored. If you're looking for the Adrenaline rush of Snow Crash, this book doesn't deliver. But if you like a well paced story that gives you a lot of think about, this is perfect.
