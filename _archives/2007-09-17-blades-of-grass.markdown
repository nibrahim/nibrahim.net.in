This is an attempt to get a few cartoony blades of grass right. It's completely in inkscape and extensively uses the "Pattern Along Path" feature which was a added just a release or two ago. It was inspired mostly by <a href="http://mrtentacleguy.deviantart.com/art/Creating-Swirls-in-Inkscape-54969362">this waves tutorial at DeviantArt</a>.

	<li>First we need to draw a the skeleton of the blades of grass. This can be done mostly using the bezier tool (shift-F6) or free hand (f6) which can be hard or creatively using the spiral tool (f9). For best results, use a combination of all three. Here are some sample shapes you can draw . Most of the curves are drawn with the bezier tool but the spiral like arc is drawn with the spiral tool.

	<li>Now, we need to create the "meat" of the blades. Draw a small triangle using the bezier tool. Use the node editing tool (f2) and select the three nodes of the triangle. Then click on the add nodes button <img alt="grass-node.png" id="image56" src="http://nibrahim.net.in/journal/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/grass-node.png" />repeatedly till the number of nodes becomes something around 700. It should look something like this.

	<li>Now select the triangle, hold shift and click on a blade skeleton (one of the lines you drew). Then use Effects->Generate from path->Pattern along path to paste it along the skeleton. You need to set "Copies of the pattern" to "Single, Stretched", Deformation type to ribbon (although snake is okay too. Try it), Pattern is vertical to true and Duplicate pattern before deformation to true. Once the effect is complete, you can delete the "skeleton" path and leave just the fleshed out one. You should end up with something like this

	<li>Repeat this process for all the blades you've drawn to get something like this. You can select all of them and use Ctrl-shift-A and align all their bottoms together to make them look like they're sprouting from a common ground. The final thing show look like this.

	<li>Now for colouring. Select all the blades (or one by one if you prefer) and open up the fill/stroke dialog (Ctrl-Shift-F). Then select a dark green for the stroke with a width of 1 pixel or so. Select a gradient for the fill and edit the gradient to start from a darkish green to black. Then use the node editing tool to adjust the gradient to start from the base of the stalks and to end around two thirds of the way to the longest one. You should end up with something like this.

	<li>For this to actually look good, you need lots of wavy stalks. Here is another example of a finished drawing.
