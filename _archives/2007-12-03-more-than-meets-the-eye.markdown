I've been a Transformers fan since I was a kid but didn't  watch the recent movie. I saw a picture of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimus_Prime">Optimus prime</a> from the new movie and he reminds of a <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/19/Optimus10108pieces.jpg">failed borg assimilation experiment</a>. Not my cup of tea. 

In any case, here's a good comparison. The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-W_3gVsO98">new movie theme by the group Mute Math</a> (I don't understand what that broken trumpet like sound is supposed to mean) versus a short version of the theme from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers:_The_Movie">1986 animated "Transformers: The Movie"</a> which can watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChlDv74gs18&feature=related">here</a> (star studded cast too). Maybe it's because I prefer glam metal to the usual emo stuff you here these days. 

They <i>do</i> have a more metallic version of the theme for the new movie <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcQuXAf0cKc&feature=related">here</a> but it's still doesn't hold a candle to the theme by Lion. On the other hand, a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLhp0US_Hj0">video of scenes from the new movie set to one of the songs from the old one's soundtrack</a> looks pretty nice.
