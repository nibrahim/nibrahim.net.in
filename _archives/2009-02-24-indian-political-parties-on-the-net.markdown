The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party">BJP</a> is a right wing nationalist Hindu party in India that's the only real competition to the rather crippled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress">Indian National Congress</a> at the centre. 

I'm not really into Indian politics (or any politics for that matter) although perhaps I should be. However, after Barack Obama's victory and his ability to leverage the masses using the internet, one would assume that everyone out there would have gotten a clue. The important BJP leaders like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lal_Krishna_Advani">LK Advani</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi">Narendra Modi</a> have really slick looking sites and are heavily advertised online (I came across the ads via my gmail snippets). There are blogs, forums and all sorts of things on the sites to encourage youth participation. The INC site is languishing in the days of web 0.5 (and so's the BJP site although I think it's the people more than the party that matters in situations like this). Rahul Gandhi's site is nonexistent. I get a 404 when I try to visit it and a lousy looking 404 page at that. On the other hand, LK Advani's ads do come up in some <a href="http://blinking-eyes.blogspot.com/2009/02/online-advertising-horror-lk-advani-for.html">funny places</a>. :)

The other 'large' party in India is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_India_(Marxist)">Communist Party of India (Marxist)</a> and they have power right now in my state (Kerala). Us Malayalis always being a little left leaning if not falling over. They had some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.M.S._Namboodiripad">good leaders</a> in the past but I digress. The CPIM site right now has one of those disturbing animated postboxes which you can click on to send mail, a couple of frames to display the navbar, a really garish background and is a total mess. Give that the current CM is palsy with Richard Stallman and is a free software supporter, they should atleast revamp their site.

Looks like it's only the BJP that's understanding the power of the internet.
