This is paraphrased from today's prayer sermon.<br />
<blockquote>A man came to a scholar and told him that he had buried his treasure somewhere but couldn't remember where. He had searched his land and couldn't find it. The scholar thought for a while and then asked him to make his ablutions and offer two cycles of prayer. The man agreed and made his ablutions. He stood on his prayer mat ready to pray and immediately, the thoughts of the world came into the head amongst them the location of his treasure. 
</blockquote>
The scholar was I think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Hanifa">Imam Abu Hanifa</a>.<br />
The anecdote serves to illustrate the extreme lack of concentration many people have when they stand up to pray.
