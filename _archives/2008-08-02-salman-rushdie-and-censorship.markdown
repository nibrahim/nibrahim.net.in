A former body guard of the author has published a book about him which he claims is full of lies and inaccuracies. Salman Rushdie is planning legal action against the bodyguard. 

Here are some nice quotes.
<blockquote>Sir Salman said the book was defamatory and is demanding that the offending chapters be removed. </blockquote>
<blockquote>He (Salman Rushdie) said: "I am not in the business of suppressing books. I just want the stuff taken out of which he knows to be untrue.
"Whenever I write something, I always want to make sure that what I write is defensible. That doesn't seem to be the case here." 
</blockquote>

I guess freedom of speech even if it offends is fine as long as <em>you</em> don't have to be on the receiving end.
