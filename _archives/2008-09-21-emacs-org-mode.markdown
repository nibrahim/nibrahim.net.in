I came across org-mode via. a Google tech. talks presentation by it's main author Carsten Dominik. This thing is <em>totally</em> on crack. 
I've wandered between tons of applications to keep notes and track lists. This beats everything and it's one more thing inside Emacs. 
I think it is worth serious study time. Download it <a href="http://orgmode.org/">here</a> and have a blast. The talk is linked to from here too.
