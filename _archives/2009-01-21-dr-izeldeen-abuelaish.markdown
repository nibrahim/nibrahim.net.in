This is really heart breaking. Having been recently blessed with a daughter, I know how much it hurts when she has even a minor cold.

Dr Izeldeen Abuelaish is a Palestinian doctor who has treated several Israelis for infertility. In their onslaught on Gaza, the Israelis fired a shell at the doctors house because "they had come under attack from somewhere in the vicinity of the house."

3 of his daughters and his niece were blown to bits by the attack. The full <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7838465.stm">report is on the BBC's site</a>. 

This is on the news because many Israelis knew the doctor given the nature of his work. There are probably hundreds of innocent arabs who lose their children, parents and loved ones to Israel's high tech weapons. How much longer will they have to endure this injustice and humiliation?
