<blockquote>Whoever withholds his anger, Allah will withhold His punishment from him. (Tabarani)</blockquote>

Very useful given the self righteousness that's so prevalent these days. A review of oneself and then careful consideration of whether to let the anger expose itself or not. May Allah make it easy for all of us.
