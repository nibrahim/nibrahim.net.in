I'd have expected something like <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1039906.html">this</a> to get more coverage than just 200 odd hits on Google news. I'd also expect that the media would focus on the actual news rather than the <a href="http://www.allnewsweb.com/page171171.php">sensationalism</a> that seems to be the norm. 

But then again, we <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent">don't live in an ideal world</a>.
