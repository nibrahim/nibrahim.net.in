title: "Hyde : An Emacs mode for Jekyll blogs"
---

I've been working on a simple mode to manage my blog entries using
Emacs and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.org). 

The mode is available at https://github.com/nibrahim/Hyde

There are still features like post drafts etc and proper reporting to
be done but this post was written, generated and deployed using the
mode so it works. Feel free to check it out and give me some feedback.
