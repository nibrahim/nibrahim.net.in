A 'new' phase in Israel's attack on Palestine is going on and innocents are getting slaughtered day after day.

Here is an article by Professor Avi Shlaim of Oxford University regarding the aggression that puts the whole thing in perspective - <a href='http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/07/gaza-israel-palestine/print'>http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/07/gaza-israel-palestine/print</a>. Not that there aren't any others out there but the Professor's credentials (former IDF soldier and supporter of the state of Israel) lend it strong credibility.
