This is one of the most scathing reveiws I've read in a long time. It's a <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n20/eagl01_.html">criticism of Richard Dawkins' book "The God Delusion"</a>. Eagleton doesn't pull any punches. It's a virulent mix of ad hominem attacks, highly cogent criticism and excellent rhetoric skill. I enjoyed reading it quite a bit.

I liked this quote. People often confuse the sacrifice of a martyr (<em>shaheed</em> in Arabic) with the lunacy and desperation of a suicide bomber. 
<blockquote>
He does not see that Christianity, like most religious faiths, values human life deeply, which is why the martyr differs from the suicide. The suicide abandons life because it has become worthless; the martyr surrenders his or her most precious possession for the ultimate well-being of others. This act of self-giving is generally known as sacrifice, a word that has unjustly accrued all sorts of politically incorrect implications.
