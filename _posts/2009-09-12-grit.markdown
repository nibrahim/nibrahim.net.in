I've had a problem with concentrating ever since I left college. I put it down to the boring work I was forced to do at my first workplace and some literature I read about honing multiple skills. The former made me deliberately not concentrate during the best 8 hours of each day and the latter made me try to diversify so much that focus became a vice rather than a virtue. 

Now that I've grown older and have had my nose rubbed in reality repeatedly, I've come to realise the value of grit or perseverance. The ability to endure boredom and other negative feelings to push ones self and get a project completed. I've been working on it and things are better than what they used to be a year ago. 

I think intelligence is severely overrated in popular discourse and perseverance has taken a back seat. This is a pity because with only the former, one is quite useless. With only the latter, one is perhaps limited to how high he can rise but it's assured that he <em>will</em> get somewhere.
