<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Winter">Shaykh Abdul Hakim Murad</a>'s series of Islamic one liners not dissimilar to Zen Koans, have always fascinated me. The full set is available at <a href="http://www.masud.co.uk/ISLAM/ahm/default.htm">Masud.co.uk</a>. The latest set (contentions 12) has recently been put online at <a href="http://www.masud.co.uk/ISLAM/ahm/contentions12.htm">http://www.masud.co.uk/ISLAM/ahm/contentions12.htm</a>. Here are some samples.
<ul>
<li>The saint is he whose presence makes you love the Prayer.</li>
<li>If your Islam does not attract pure hearts, it is not Islam.</li>
<li>If you put down your <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misbaha">tasbih</a></em> you will not pick up a rifle safely.</li>
<li>The wife’s vulnerability is not the husband’s strength.</li>
<li>Do not use your beard to open people’s ears.</li>
<li>A politician deals with symptoms, a leader deals with causes.</li>
<li>You cannot arrive by making an effort, but you cannot arrive without making an effort.</li>
</ul>
Allah bless him. He's one of the most learned and articulate modern Islamic scholars around.
