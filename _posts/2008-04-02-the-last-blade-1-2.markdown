One of the most popular game genres especially for the coin operated arcade machines of yesteryear were the fighters. The games where two controllable characters (or teams) face off in a match. Modern fighters include DOA, Tekken etc. The game that actually propelled fighting games into the spotlight was the immortal Street Fighter II from Capcom. This was followed by a spate of clones and half completed disasters in an attempt to cash in on the genre. Most of them were horrible and pretty much failed (Kasumi Ninja, Fighters history etc.). Some were successful and have carved their own niches (eg. Mortal Kombat). 

SNK was a company that has had a successful series of fighting games. Their most popular and lucrative franchise I think is the King of fighters series. Amongst their large number of titles in this genre is a little known gem called "The last blade". They released part 2 a little after the original one and improved upon the original in a few minor ways. Some games stun people by pure ingenuity - a new idea, a new technique, a new piece of technology etc. The last blade is not one of these. This is a game which took a tied and tested concept (a fighter) and used pure style and art to elevate it into something else. 

The game is set during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakumatsu">Bakumatsu</a> and each character in the game has a personal agenda of some kind set against the backdrop of an opening of a gate between the earth and the netherworld. The "arenas" in the game are usually traditional Japanese settings - A village festival, a cherry blossom viewing, a paddy farm at sunset time etc. They also often have people in western clothing as onlookers. The music is moody and nostalgic unlike the usual stuff you have in fighting games which is designed to get the blood pumping. Various elements of Japanese mythology are incorporated into the storyline. The character sprites are detailed and really fit into the scenes. The whole package gives one a feeling of the end of an era. It's surprising to see this much atmosphere in a fighting game. 

All the characters fight with weapons. Many of them use katanas. One of the characters named Moriya has a move called the moon slice during which his sword traces out the shape of a full moon. It's probably the only move I've seen that looks nicer than the SF2's legendary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_punch">Dragon Punch</a>.

The game has a "repel" button which I've not seen in many others. Pressed at the right time during an attack, it will cause your character to block and strike back. If used strategically, it can make the difference between victory and death.

It's definitely worth playing if you like fighters. But even if you don't it's worth simply seeing due to the care that has gone in to create  the feel which is unique to this game. The last blade is playable using the <a href="http://mamedev.org/">MAME</a> arcade emulator. The roms are available on <a href="http://www.romnation.net/">Romnation.net</a>.
