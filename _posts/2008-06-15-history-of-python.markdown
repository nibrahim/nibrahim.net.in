A beautiful visualisation of the python source repository since Guido made it public in 1991.

I love the way the documentation (blue bubbles) gravitates towards Fred Drake and the way in which all hell breaks loose in 2000 or so. :)

A friend at work and I were recently discussing the organisation and quality of code in open source and proprietary projects. He was working in an open source company for a while and was telling me how neatly things were organised there. There were discussions going on on how to improve the quality of code -- processes, unit testing etc. My usual line in these situations is that code will become good and nice only if the engineers <em>want</em> it to be. It'll become exemplary if people invest themselves into the code. If you use a whip and a bag of money to squeeze commitment out of people, you won't get any (except the kind that you get when you squeeze and we all know how good that is). I wonder if it's possible to do some kind of visualisation like this for our company codebase. Might reveal some interesting things like ownerships, proficiency in areas, etc.
