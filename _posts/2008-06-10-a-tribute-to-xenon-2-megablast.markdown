The <a href="http://www.bitmap-brothers.co.uk/">Bitmap Brothers</a> were a game development company based in the UK. Apart from a cool name, they have some really nice games to their credit - notably <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenon_2:_Megablast">Xenon 2:Megablast</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gods_%28video_game%29">Gods</a> and Speedball. They were one of the first people to use professional musicians for their game soundtracks. The song "Megablast" by Bomb the Bass used for Xenon 2 is an example. I've lost track of the number of hours I blew on the game. 

In an attempt to improve my Python-fu and to realise an old dream which I had, I've been spending the past few evenings on making a clone of the original Xenon 2 with some twists and quirks. It's a Steampunk version of the game with some older fashioned weapons (think Steam cannon etc.). I have some other ideas which are slowly getting implemented and the results (apart from the artwork which is either my own or cut out from screenshots of Xenon 2) looks rather nice. The whole thing is rather simple programming wise and it's more of a creative rather than a technical endeavour. 

I'll probably be done with a basic playable version in a week or two and I'll upload it then. The game is written in python and uses the Python SDL bindings knows as PyGame. Saying that it's a delight programming in python is redundant so I won't say it. 

Here's a screenshot of one of the title cards. It's supposed to look like an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertitle">intertitle</a> from a black and white movie.
