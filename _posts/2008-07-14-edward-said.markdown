Videos of the late Palestinian American Professor and famous author of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientalism_(book)">Orientalism</a>" - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Said">Edward Said</a>. I especially enjoyed the series on Orientalism.
<a href="http://sheikhynotes.blogspot.com/2008/07/edward-said.html">Four part video on Orientalism</a> and <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6705627964658699201&q=Edward+Said&ei=kHN7SNKfOIjkqgPToMCLCw">A lecture critical of Samuel Huntington's famous 'Clash of Civilisations' idea</a>.

I picked up the book a year or two ago and stopped reading it halfway because of it's density. I think I need to budget some dedicated time and get back to it one of these days.
