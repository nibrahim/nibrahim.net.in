Given the disputatious dispositions of many people these days (myself included), this hadith should help Insha Allah.

<blockquote>Narrated Abu Umamah: Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) said: “I guarantee a home in paradise for a person who gives up arguments and disputes even if he is on the truth. And (I also guarantee) a home in the middle of Paradise for a person who gives up lying (false statements) even when joking. And (I also guarantee) a home in the highest part of Paradise for a person who has a high standard of character.” (Abu Dawud & At-Tirmidhi)</blockquote>

Sometimes, it's <b>so</b> hard to keep quiet. One just <b>has</b> to prove that one is right :-/.
