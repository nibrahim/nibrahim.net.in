Richard Dawkins often refers to the concept of a shifting moral zeitgeist as a source of our morality. The basic idea (as far as I understand) is that morals are not absolute and that they are shaped by the societies we live in. What was once moral might after attainment of a certain level maturity become immoral to our eyes. He says
<blockquote>There seems to be a steadily shifting standard of what is morally acceptable... Something... has shifted in all of us, and the shift has no connection with religion. If anything, it happens in spite of religion, not because of it.</blockquote>
To support his view, he uses the example of racism and quotes 3 people who at their times were stalwart defenders of human equality. 
The first one
<blockquote>
no rational man, cognisant of the facts, believes that the average negro is the equal, still less the superior, of the average white man. And, if this be true, it is simply incredible that, when all his disabilities are removed, and our prognathous relative has a fair field and no favour, as well as no oppressor, he will be able to compete successfully with his bigger-brained and smaller-jawed rival, in a contest which is to be carried on by thoughts and not by bites. The highest places in the hierarchy of civilisation will assuredly not be within the reach of our dusky cousins, though it is by no means necessary that they should be restricted to the lowest.
--<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Henry_Huxley">Thomas Henry Huxley</a> (1871)</i>
</blockquote>
The second.
<blockquote>
I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races. I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of making voters or jurors of Negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people. There is a physical difference between the white and black races, which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality.
--<i><a href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=3487">Abraham Lincoln</a> (1858) </i>
</blockquote>
thirdly
<blockquote>
And how will the New Republic treat the inferior races?  How will it deal with the black? how will it deal with the yellow man? how will it tackle the alleged termite in the civilized world, the Jew?"
--<i><a href="http://jkalb.freeshell.org/rants/h_g_wells.html">H.G. Wells</a> (1904)
</i></blockquote>
He then goes on say how if Lincoln and Huxley were born and educated in the 21st century, they would cringe at these statements and would fight against such sentiments because the zeitgeist has shifted and morals today are different. The picture painted is one of a society that's becoming more and more morally sensitive and that things which passed as acceptable a few decades ago would become morally unacceptable in this time. 
His explanation of the changes is that they originate from the general social circumstances, the ideas which are in vogue and from the complex interactions of human beings in the times they live in. He finally asserts that that our moral values do not come from religion at all and the zeitgeist moves inspite of religion. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwz6B8BFkb4">Full clip available here</a>.

Just to balance the scenario a little bit, I'm quoting a person who we Muslims consider far more enlightened, fair and just than Huxley, Lincoln and Wells. These words were spoken a little earlier than the ones quoted above. They were uttered in 632. The zeitgest had probably not shifted all that much and the people were grossly immoral savages.
<blockquote>
All mankind is from Adam and Eve, an Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab nor a non-Arab has any superiority over an Arab; also a white has no superiority over black nor does a black have any superiority over white except by piety and good action. 
-- <i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Farewell_Sermon">Prophet Muhammad (Allah bless him and give him peace)</a> (632)</i>
</blockquote>

So, either Huxley and company missed out on the shift in the zeitgeist or they were (even for their own times) grossly racist and culturally insensitive. The common arguments that people like Dawkins and Harris make about how we cherry pick good verses from our scriptures is nonsense. There is no cherry picking. Some people pick out only verses that they like and end up as watered down people without backbones or as blood thirsty maniacs. Some people cherry pick verses and consider that these verses as the complete content of the scriptures and criticise them. Genuine scholars and seekers take the scripture as a whole along with the unwritten guidance that has been transmitted down to us by people and it transforms them into viceregents of God in the world.

If anything, the moral zeitgeist has moved us away from true morality and not towards a more perfect form of it. As Shaykh Abdul Hakim Murad says in his contentions <em>"We have not grown out of the Shariâ€˜a, we have shrunk out of it."</em>
