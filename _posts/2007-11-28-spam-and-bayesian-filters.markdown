Ever get the feeling that the non spam content which spammers use to bypass your statistical filters might actually be interesting? I recently got a spam post on my blog that (among other things) pointed to a <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=j_aONMdkzxU">video</a> in which a video game character does Christopher Walken's dance to the Fatboy Slim song "weapon of choice". Not exactly my kind of thing but nonetheless, not bad. It might be interesting to see bots that can actually participate in an intelligent conversation but who nevertheless drop in spam links now and then. Cory Doctorow actually got paid by someone who saw an excerpt of his novel in a spam mail as he recounts <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7774">here</a>. Go figure.
