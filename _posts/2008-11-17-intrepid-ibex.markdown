Installed the latest Ubuntu (8.10) on my thinkpad after long period of not upgrading. Almost had a deal breaker with Emacs + Metacity. (Details <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/299019">here</a>). This has forced me to use the non gtk emacs without AA fonts. I'm sort of used to blocky Terminus for coding so it's not bad. I do prefer Inconsolata though. Let's see if it's gets fixed. 

Apart from that, it's quite nice. Things work well and the number of reasons to prefer Windows (XP, Vista whatever) or to join the cult of Apple are no longer convincingly strong. 

An aside on Apple. The almost religious fanaticism of some Mac users repels me from their hardware/software quite a bit. It's just a computer for God's sake. Get a grip! Also, it occurs to me that OS development for Apple is <em>much</em> easier than for Linux and Windows. The latter two have to run on arbitrary hardware and do a good job. OSX simply has to run for a fixed set of components on a single machine.

In other news, I'm slowly making my way though Neal Stephenson's Anathem. Lovely book and my favourite of the books by Stephenson which I've read so far. After this and some other pending books, I intend to negotiate the baroque cycle.
