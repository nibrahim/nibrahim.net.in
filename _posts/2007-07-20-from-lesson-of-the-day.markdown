Hadith of the Day:
Remember God always, read Gods prescriptions in the Holy Book, because that will shed light upon your life in this world and secure Gods remembrance of you in the heavens. And watch your tongue even when you speak beneficently. If you do these things, you will resist the temptations of the accursed Devil. [Tabarani]

Wise Quote of the Day:
Stay away from abomination of sin that may deface your purity. The Lord shall bless you with much bounty; therefore let not the cares of this world drive your peace away. [Shaykh Abdul Qadir Jilani]

<strong>Wise Quote of the Day:
</strong>Just as the effect of an atom's weight of food or drink or medicine is not lost on the body, so too the effect of an atom's weight of goodness or evil is not lost either in drawing near to God's door or in estrangement from Him. [Ibn Ata'Allah]
