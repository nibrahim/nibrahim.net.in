I wish I had read <a href="http://www.netsplit.com/blog/articles/2007/09/26/why-i-choose-bazaar-a-history-of-revision-control">this</a> <strong>before </strong>I spent all that time learning how to use svn and perforce effectively.

I wonder if bzr has someway of interacting with perforce changelists. <a href="http://public.perforce.com/guest/robert_cowham/perforce/API/python/index.html">p4 has a python API </a>.
