Imam Abu Abd al-Rahman al-Sulami (Allah have mercy on him),

one of the great sufi masters, wrote in his work <strong>The Proper Manners of

Companionship </strong>(Adab al-Suhba) that,
<blockquote>Proper companionship with one’s friends is through:

[1] Remaining constantly cheerful

[2] Doing the good

[3] Spreading mention of their virtues

[4] Concealing their errors

[5] Considering great this little acts of good

[6] Considering little anything one does for them

[7] Taking care of them with one’s person and wealth

[8] Avoiding malice, envy, harming, hurting, and all matters

that they dislike, in any way

[9] Leaving anything one would have to apologize for.</blockquote>
