The injunction to "command the good and forbid the evil" is one of the hardest things to carry out in Islam. There's always the danger of coming across as a hard headed, unsympathetic preacher and causing more harm than good. Shaykh Nuh in one of his Suhba recordings mentions that it was one of the hardest obligations he faced. A hadith from the excellent <a href="http://lessonsoftheday.blogspot.com/">Lessons of the day</a> in this regard.
<blockquote>If you see only the faults and errors of people and tell them harshly to their faces, even if your intentions are to free them of their faults, you may easily lead them deeper into mischief and sedition. [Abu Dawud]</blockquote>
May Allah make us one of his elect by the blessing of this holy month.
