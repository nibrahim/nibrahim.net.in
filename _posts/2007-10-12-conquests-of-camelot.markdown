Where have the days of adventure games where you actually had to type gone? The more graphics things got, the less intelligent the text parsers became. There were interactive fiction games where you could type things like "bill, go up and bring me the book" and bill would actually do it. <br />
That kind of intelligence was not present in the early Sierra games but they were still not bad. The original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_Game_Interpreter">AGI</a> games and then later the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra%27s_Creative_Interpreter">SCI</a> ones. Then they shifted to the mouse/icon based system which ran their later games like Police Quest 3 etc.<br />
One of the strong things about the Sierra games (as opposed to the Lucasarts ones) were their excellent story writers. While Lucasarts SCUMM engine gave us many gems like the original Secret of Monkey Island and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, I've never played anything from them that even came close to the storylines in some of the more serious Sierra classics. One of Sierra's good writers was <a href="http://www.christymarx.com/">Christy Marx</a> who wrote Conquests of Camelot and Conquests of the Longbow. The former is about King Arthur's search for the grail and the latter about Robin Hood.<br /><br />
Conquests of Camelot used the early 16 colour EGA version of the SCI engine. It had mouse support but you still had to type things like "take sword" etc. to get things done. A curse has fallen on the land of Camelot and the only way to raise it is to recover the Holy Grail. King Arthur sends three of his best knights (Sir Gwaine, Sir Lancelot and Sir Galahad) to obtain it but they do not return. He decides to go out in search of his knights and the grail itself. The wizard Merlin accompanies his king in spirit and serves as a guide. The journeys take him to various places including the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glastonbury_Tor">Glastonbury Tor</a>, the lady of the lake and Jerusalem. He finally recovers the artifact, returns to his kingdom and frees the land from the curse.<br />
The dialogues in the game use a lot of archaic spelling (eg. magick). Quite a fiew of the puzzles are genuinely puzzles and not thinly veiled copy protection schemes (although those abound as well). The scoring system is innovative. You have strength points, intelligence points and soul points. Each of these increment based on your actions (defeating an enemy would give you strength points, solving a puzzle intelligence and doing a good deed, soul points). When you finally reach the grail, your worthiness to posses it depends on these three. The music is excellent. Here is a sample of the intro - <a id="p106" rel="attachment" href="http://nibrahim.net.in/journal/?attachment_id=106" title="camelot-intro.ogg">camelot-intro.ogg</a>. The graphics are not bad and the atmosphere although a little lacking is satisfactory. There are a few annoying arcade sequences which get my goat. On the overall, a nice game to play if you like Arthurian legend and old adventure games. <br />
