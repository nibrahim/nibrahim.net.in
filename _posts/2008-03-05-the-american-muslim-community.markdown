A contest to portray the American Muslim community was held by the organisation called One Nation. The winning entry was this video by Lena Khan set to music by Kareem Salama. It's quite nicely done. Worth watching.

I wish more videos and articles that portray the Muslim community's diversity become popular as opposed to the kind of thing which you usually see on TV. <br /><i>via <a href="http://religiousfreaks.com/2008/03/04/broccoli-is-my-personal-jihad">Religious Freaks</a></i>
