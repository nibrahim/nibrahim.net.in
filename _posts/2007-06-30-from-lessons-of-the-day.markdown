The major sins, which are nine in number, are as follows:  associating partners with Allah, murdering a soul, running from battle,  accusing an innocent woman falsely, taking usury, spending the wealth  of orphans, talking heresy in the mosque, making light of religion, and  causing one's parents to shed tears because of one's disobedience.  [Bukhari]

Those who were destroyed before you were destroyed due to three  traits -- excess in speech, excess in food, and excess in sleep.  [Ibrahim al Nakhai]
