One of the favourite topics which 'brave Muslim dissidents' like Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Wafa Sultan and 'experts on Islam' like Robert Spencer love to bring up now and then is the dress code which many Muslim women follow (veils, scarves and more technically, the covering of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awrah">Awrah</a>). 

It's arrogant and foolhardy of course to assume that "the west" is the beacon of light and that everyone is to be measured by how close they are to the west. But this whole thing about how Muslim women are not in touch with their sexuality is also plain wrong. <a href="http://web.me.com/kelly_walsh/Visual_Musings/Home/Entries/2008/9/19_Behind_the_veil_lives_a_thriving_Muslim_sexualityBy_Naomi_Wolf.html">Here's an article</a> I came across from the excellent <a href="http://amonhen.blogspot.com/2008/09/thriving-muslim-sexuality.html">Amonhen</a> which describes the reality of the lives of women in some traditionally Islamic countries. Excellent read. 

Here's a sample quote.
<blockquote>
Nor are Muslim women alone. The Western Christian tradition portrays all sexuality, even married sexuality, as sinful. Islam and Judaism never had that same kind of mind-body split. So, in both cultures, sexuality channeled into marriage and family life is seen as a source of great blessing, sanctioned by God.
