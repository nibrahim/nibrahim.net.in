An <a href='http://www.spiritual-tendencies.com/2009/03/sincerity-in-calling-oneself-to-account/'>excellent article</a> on an excellent blog. I was quite depressed when the incredibly talented <a href="http://www.shaikr.com/">Shaikr</a> decided to pull the original version of this blog offline. Now it's back with a better (greener?) look and the same high quality content. May Allah reward him. I'm surprised I don't see him more on the internet. 

The article itself is an excerpt from a lecture by Shaykh Habib Ali Jiffri who's one of the beacons of light that people like me can't see even if I was standing right in front of it. This is what struck me the most. 
<blockquote>
Indeed, that is abasement itself: for Allah to turn the heart of a servant away from seeking to attain nearness to Him!
</blockquote>

The lack of yearning. The lack of pain. The lack of anguish. The satisfaction or even worse, the pain due to lack of material wealth. Very painful indeed.

May Allah make us yearn for him.
