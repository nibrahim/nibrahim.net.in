Ever since I saw Carsten Dominik deliver the <a href="http://orgmode.org/GoogleTech.html">Google tech talk on Emacs org-mode</a>, I've been a total believer. I've waded through quite a few applications (web based and otherwise) to track tasks and keep notes (Emacs remember, Tomboy, a personal wiki, I forget the rest) and nothing has come close to the convenience and power of org-mode. The fact that Carsten was such a nice guy at the talk might have contributed to me trying out the mode but then again <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8">non nice guys</a> haven't stopped me from adopting other tools. 

These days, it's where all my stuff goes. Quick notes during meetings, status reports, daily reports with some numerical data (thanks org-tbl!), project planning, spec authoring etc. I've managed to hook it up to my Gnus setup so that my mail gets tied up project wise which is useful. 

One of the greatest parts is that it finally stores everything as plain ASCII text files. This when put into a distributed version control system like git or bzr allows me to synchronise my task and project lists acros different computers and places. Keeping specification documents under version control also allows me to build up a timeline of how the customers changed the spec over time so that we can account for the delays and stuff. 

All this stuff had let to sort of workflow for me which might not be optimal but which I had fun setting up and using. I've tried to distill this into a talk which I'm hoping to deliver at <a href="http://devcamp.in">Dev camp, Bangalore</a>. I'm quite nervous since the crowd there is going to be quite smart. Let's hope it goes well. See you all there! :)
