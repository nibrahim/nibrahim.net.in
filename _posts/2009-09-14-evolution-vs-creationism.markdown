The <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/6173399/Charles-Darwin-film-too-controversial-for-religious-America.html">latest chapter</a> of the long running comedy that is the evolution vs. creationism debate.

Where do people find some much time on their hands? I'm sure it's an interesting topic to some evolutionary biologists, most American televangelists and other rabble rousers but the majority of the population left or right, atheist or religious *simply* *don't* *care*. Sure, it fun to debate it over a coffee table and poke some archaic religious beliefs but that's soon forgotten and people walk out together unfazed by the discussion.

The religious nut jobs denounce the whole thing as the work of the devil and blame Darwinism for the moral depravity of society. They conjure up an entire pseudo science called "Intelligent design" and spend millions of dollars on promoting it in schools and even build museums to advertise the whole thing.

The proud militant atheists on the other hand led (as best as I can tell) by Richard Dawkins use this as a rhetorical weapon to discredit religion and theism as whole. Any religious person who wants to talk about something genuine is usually greeted with a question about what his views are on evolution and then dissected. Isn't it plain to them that even if they wanted to propagate an idea, bashing other peoples dearest beliefs is simply not the way to go about it?

It should be obvious to anyone with half a brain that Evolution is a scientific position based on facts and a well tested hypothesis. It's an effective tool to predict results and gives us a good framework to understand many of the biological realities of our state. There is of course the whole question of whether with this fanatic zeal that we see so much of these days has reduced it from scientific fact to dogma but that's for another day.
It should also be obvious to anyone with half a brain that Creationism is a faith based position. It's a belief in something similar to a belief in God. I don't think there's anyone in the history of human civilisation who has believed in God purely for intellectual reasons. Asking people for proofs for such beliefs in dumb and missing the point. The only answer is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_(negative)">Mu</a>. Religion in all it's forms is faith and you have to want to believe in order to do so.

The Archbishop of Canterbury's position on the whole 'intelligent design' thing that it's category error (an attempt to repackage faith as a science and advertise it) is something I find myself agreeing with.

Back when I was in school and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrasah">madrassah</a>, we were taught the religious viewpoint and the scientific viewpoint. They both didn't agree and we didn't care. I don't recollect a single debate about it. I grew up and didn't think about it either. Yes, I knew the dissonance between the two versions and I don't think I cared about anything less than that. In short, I don't think it's an issue.

If you're actively working on something to further humanity or to do some good and require a strict position on the question, you have to consider your options and choose. For better or for worse, there are two conflicting options which are based on completely different foundations. You have to decide where you lean and make your choice. The rest of us simply don't care and don't have the time or energy to get dragged into the debate.
I for one would love to have the loonies on both sides locked up in a room and left there to duke it out amongst themselves. Once the ashes settle, the rest of us, evolutionists and creationists can get on with our lives and get some work done.

THERE! That felt good.
