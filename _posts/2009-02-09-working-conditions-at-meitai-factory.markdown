<a href="http://www.nlcnet.org/article.php?id=613">Here</a> is an article on the working conditions in a major Chinese computer keyboard factory. It's hard to believe that this is the real world and not something out of a story. The details of fines and the already low wages are simply sickening. 

Given how much I complain about work being boring and pay being insufficient, this kind of stuff is exactly what I need to get my focus back. 

Most of the practices by the factory are illegal under Chinese law but like all powerful corporate entities, they've probably found ways around that.
