One of Coleridge's most famous poems. You can't come up with stuff like
<blockquote>
Day after day, day after day,
We stuck, nor breath nor motion;
As Idle as a painted ship 
upon a painted ocean
<br />
Water, water, everywhere
And all the boards did shrink.
Water, water, everywhere
Nor any drop to drink.
</blockquote>
without a <em>good</em> amount of natural talent. 
The poem in it's entirety is available at <a href="http://etext.virginia.edu/stc/Coleridge/poems/Rime_Ancient_Mariner.html">http://etext.virginia.edu/stc/Coleridge/poems/Rime_Ancient_Mariner.html</a>  (with scans of engravings).

If you're a metal person, Iron Maiden did a rather long song based on the poem quoting many of it's lines. You can listen to it <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97pV7Z3EX_o">here</a> although it's a little too noisy. 

It's a pity that the Wandering Minstrels poem a day service has stopped. I used to enjoy it a lot.
