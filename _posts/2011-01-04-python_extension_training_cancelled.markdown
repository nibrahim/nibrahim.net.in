title: "Python extension training cancelled"
---

The [extension training](/2010/11/22/python_extension_training.html)
which I had planned for Jan 8,9th is cancelled due to a lack of
participation. 

On the other hand, a shortened version of the tutorial has been
accepted for [PyCon 2011](http://us.pycon.org). I will be presenting
it over there and if there's sufficient interest, will put up the
slides/material on my site here.
