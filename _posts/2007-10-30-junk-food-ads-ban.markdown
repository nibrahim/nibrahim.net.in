Would you support an absolute ban on Junk food advertisement especially ones targeted towards children? I think I would. I went to a Chinese Restaurant recently near which there was a McDisaster. The children gravitated towards their counters thanks to the Balloons, Ronald and other advertising paraphernalia. <br />Sure it's upto the parents to monitor what their children eat but it's hard for them to put up much of a battle against Ronald and his army especially when they have established strategic points at most shopping malls, recreational areas and even in their houses (via. the TV). <a href="http://choice.com.au/viewArticle.aspx?id=105275&catId=100288&tid=100008&p=2&title=Food+marketing%3a+child's+play%3f">Here's</a> some more on the advertising techniques used. - <i>From <a href="http://www.kathrynelliott.com.au/blog/2007/10/30/would-you-support-a-world-wide-ban-on-junk-food-advertising">Limes and Licopene</a>.</i> which is a blog I recommend.
