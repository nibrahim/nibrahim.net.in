<a href="http://www.yursil.com/blog/2007/11/ottoman-aid-to-the-irish/">Turkish aid to the Irish from Yursil's excellent blog</a>. 
Notable quotes.
<blockquote>
In 1845, the onset of the Great Irish Famine resulted in over 1,000,000 deaths. Ottoman Sultan Abdülmecid declared his intention to send 10,000 sterling to Irish farmers but Queen Victoria requested that the Sultan send only 1,000 sterling, because she had sent only 2,000 sterling. The Sultan sent the 1,000 sterling but also secretly sent 3 ships full of food. The English courts tried to block the ships, but the food arrived Drogheda harbor and was left there by Ottoman Sailors.

Due to this the Irish people, especially those in Drogheda, are friendly to the Turks. This event led to the appearance of Ottoman symbols on Drogheda United’s emblem.</blockquote>

A lot of Muslim involvement in history is being distorted and/or excised from History books. Some of it because the Muslims suffered lots of military and political defeats and it's the victors who write history. Some of it is due to blatant anti-Muslim fundamentalism. A good example is the whole <a href="http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/07/22/stories/0222000v.htm">saffronisation</a> of textbooks going on in India eg. accounts of Aurangzeb's rule have radically changed from my father's textbook to my younger brothers.
