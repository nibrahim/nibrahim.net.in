The <a href="http://suhba.org/public/pub_lessons_sufipath.html">lectures by Shakh Nuh Keller on the Sufi Path</a> which are as electrifying to me today as they were 4 or 5 years ago when I first listened to them. <b>Very</b> highly recommended. 

Listening to these lectures attentively and meeting my <a href="http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Group/Position/627223">Ustad</a> seriously for the first time to ask for his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dua">Duas</a> were perhaps the two most life altering events to hit me in the past decade. Alhamdulillah!
