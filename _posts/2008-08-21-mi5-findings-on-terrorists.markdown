An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MI5">MI5</a> 'restricted' report says that religious literacy and being faithful to the religion actually reduces the chances of getting caught up in terrorist groups and activities. 
Quote:
<blockquote>Far from being religious zealots, a large number of those involved in terrorism do not practise their faith regularly. Many lack religious literacy and could actually be regarded as religious novices. Very few have been brought up in strongly religious households, and there is a higher than average proportion of converts. Some are involved in drug-taking, drinking alcohol and visiting prostitutes. MI5 says there is evidence that a well-established religious identity actually protects against violent radicalisation. </blockquote>
&lt;sarcasm&gt;Surprise eh?&lt;/sarcasm&gt;
