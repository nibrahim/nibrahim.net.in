It occurs to me that ones position on things of a spiritual nature require active defence in this day and age. It's not a total open search for truth anymore. How long can one vacillate? Convictions need protection and it should require more than just a few dozen books and discussions to change a persons mind. If we were really that fickle in our notions, we'd hover around uncertainty all our lives. 

Apart from the sheer amount of irrelevant nonsense (eg. Hollywood) that the net exposes us to, there's a general tendency in modern discourse that either mocks and rejects (the Dawkins variety of atheism) or trivialises and waters down (the new age version of spirituality) religion. There is a need to be selective. 

Therefore, I feel that it's not as much of an active search as it is an act of focussing. Mere ideas cannot give one a coherent picture of life. The entire human composite should play a part and if it doesn't, it's intellectual dilly dallying at best.
