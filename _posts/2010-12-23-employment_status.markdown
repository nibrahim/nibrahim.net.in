title: "Employment status"
---

Its been around a year since I
[took the plunge](http://nibrahim.net.in/journal/?p=265). I worked for
a few organisations, did a few trainings and generally had an
educational and profitable year. I attended two PyCons abroad,
conducted one here, met a lot of interesting people, got myself a
[new laptop](http://twitpic.com/1wx0wg), got exposed to a whole gamut
of things which were completely new to me (like managing my finances
by myself) and generally had a really wild ride. 

I thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience and am the richer for it. I
won't deny that there were times when I felt that it was a mistake and
almost regretted it but those were transient feelings.

It's hard to make a "list of things I learnt" since most of them can't
really be verbalised properly. However, if you have some risk taking
ability and a desire to stretch your limits, I highly recommend it. 

Earlier this month, I got a job offer from the
[Open Library](http://openlibrary.org) project (a sub project of the
Internet Archive) via. [Anand](http://anandology.com/). I accepted it
and starting Jan, I'll be working for them remotely. Lots of
challenges, all code is free software, decent pay, and work that has a
positive social impact - What more can one ask for?

We'll probably be setting up a small office of sorts somewhere in
[Benson town](http://www.mybangalore.com/locality/benson-town.html)
and over time are planning to convert it into a
[hacker space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace).

My [trainings](/trainings.html) will still be there. I will make
announcements over time. It's not something I want to give up but I
don't think I'll be taking any large projects anytime soon.
