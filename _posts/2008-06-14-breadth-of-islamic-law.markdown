MereIslam has posted a video by one of the most articulate and wise people I've had the fortune to hear (although not to meet - someday perhaps) Shaykh Abdul Hakim Murad. It's available <a href="http://www.mereislam.info/2008/06/abdal-hakim-murad-on-new-jahiliyyah.html">here</a> and is the introduction of the radical middle way conference. A wonderful speech. 

All of it is worth listening to but I especially likes his comments about the amount of information and the details of the Prophet's (Allah bless him and give him peace) life that has come down to us. 

Islamic law is incredibly detailed and spreads through all aspects of human personal and social life with prohibitions, recommendations and obligations. Teachings range from how to clean yourself after using the toilet to how to clean the soul of it's blameworthy traits. That's on a personal level. And in the social dimension, these teachings offer guidance in the construction of bath houses and toilets to the construction of mosques and madrassas (schools). This might sound a little silly to many people but it was the detailed rulings on cleanliness that helped Muslim Spain mitigate the impact of the black death when it devastated most of Europe. The requirement of running water for purification also helped a lot of city planning in these parts because a city's religious life would get seriously injured if this wasn't there. The breadth is truly awe inspiring and the more one reads/learns about it, the more one is fascinated with it. 

And just like Mere Islam says, the Shaykhs point about the importance of focussing ones spiritual energies and striving at ones own ego to cleanse it is perhaps the single most important theme in the whole presentation.
