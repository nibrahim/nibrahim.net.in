<a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/weir07292008.html">Israel's treatment of a Palestinian Journalist</a> who was the winner of Martha Gelhorn Prize for Journalism. The youngest recipient ever and one of the few non-Britons to get it. This is depressing.
Quotes from the article:

<blockquote>Eventually, Omer was transferred to a Palestinian hospital, but only after Israeli officials tried to force him to sign a paper absolving them from responsibility.
</blockquote><blockquote>
“In other words, if I died or was permanently disabled as a result of Israel’s actions, Israel could not be held accountable. One would think I was in a third world dictatorship rather than the ‘only democracy in the Middle East’. One would think.”</blockquote>
