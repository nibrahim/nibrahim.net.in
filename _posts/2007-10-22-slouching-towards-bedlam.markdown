<a href="http://mostlyyes.tumblr.com/">Shajith</a> mentioned during one of our conversations the <a href="http://www.inform-fiction.org/I7/Welcome.html">Inform system</a> and it's use to create Z-code files which can be run using interpreters like <a href="http://frotz.homeunix.org/frotz/">frotz</a>. The whole interactive fiction genre is extremely interesting. Some of the games in the archives (<a href="http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXgames.html">1</a>,<a href="http://www.csd.uwo.ca/Infocom/">2</a>) are literary works of art.</p><p>
I came across a game called <a href="http://peccable.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=14&Itemid=27">Slouching towards bedlam</a> which won a couple of awards. I tried it out and was totally impressed. I don't want to kill the fun by giving out spoilers here to anyone who might want to play it. The game is set in a Victorian era with steam powered clockwork automatons (steampunk). You even have a personal analytical engine named Triage following you in the game. Some of the elements of the plot reminded me of Neal Stephenson's Snowcrash. The <em>in media res</em> beginning and the gradual development of the story are done very nicely. The endings presented as appendices to the adventure and the multiple paths one can take make the game quite replayable. Definitely worth playing if you like these kinds of games. </p><p>
The images that a sentence like <em>"The slight wind whistles tunelessly against this mesh of steel, which arcs from one massive, opened gate to another."</em> are far more detailed and life like that anything a 3D engine can ever render if one has the imagination. Truly, the advances in hardware have become the death of creative gaming. Still, there is hope. The <a href="http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Main_Page">Interactive fiction wiki</a> is a good resource and the Inform language I mentioned above has an Emacs mode (though not for Inform 7 which is the most novel like of the languages). It's definitely an outlet for creative ability.</p>
