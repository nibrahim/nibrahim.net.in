title: "Git training course"

I will be conducting a public course on [Git](http://git-scm.com")
during [FOSSMeet 2011](http://fossmeet.in/2011/) at my alma mater,
[NIT, Calicut](http://www.nitc.ac.in/nitc/index.jsp).

The course will probably be held on Sunday, 6th February 2011 but the
[official schedule](http://fossmeet.in/2011/schedule) is a more
reliable source of information. 

The details of the course including slides are available at the
[training page](/presentations/git/index.html).
