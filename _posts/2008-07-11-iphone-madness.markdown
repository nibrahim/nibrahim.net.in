<a href="http://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/5-reasons-to-avoid-iphone-3g/blogentry_view">5 reasons to avoid the iphone</a> from the FSF
<a href="http://www.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2008/02/securitymatters_0207">With iPhone, 'Security' Is Code for 'Control'</a> by Bruce Schneier.

Also, to broaden the horizon a little, here's a what <a href="http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=iphone">Maddox has to say about the iPhone</a> and about <a href="http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=macs_cant">Apple in general</a> (warning: <em>strong</em> language). :)

I think the best part of Apple was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">the Woz</a>. Without him, Apple feels like a slicker and better looking Microsoft.
