At the risk of sounding like a luddite, perhaps we should just unplug. 
<blockquote>
We live meanly, like ants. Our life is frittered away by detail. An honest man has hardly need to count more than his ten fingers, or in extreme cases he may add his ten toes, and lump the rest. Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity! I say, let your affairs be as two or three, and not a hundred or a thousand; instead of a million, count half a dozen, and keep your account on your thumbnail. - <i>Henry David Thoreau, Walden </i>
