War and occupation brutalises people. I think that's quite uncontroversial. In a situation like in Palestine where the occupation has been going on for the better part of the last century, this kind of behaviour will be extremely high. A lot of apologists for Israel bring up the issue of how Israeli soldiers are trained in the holiness of arms and how this prevents such actions. Apparently, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,,2196019,00.html">that's not true</a>.
