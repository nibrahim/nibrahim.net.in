The Beyond belief conference hosted at <a title="Beyond belief 2006" href="http://beyondbelief2006.org/">http://beyondbelief2006.org/</a> consisted of a number of Nobel laureates and other respected scientists discussing various aspects of religion. There were people ranging from the vocal atheists like Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris to agnostics like Paul Davies and openly religious people like Joan Roughgarden.

The debates were quite nice for the most part. Some of the speakers were extremely eloquent. Here are my thoughts on the various speakers.
<ol>
	<li>Richard Dawkins - Irreverent as ever with some thoughts on conciousness raising, the moral zeitgeist and intellectual abuse of children by religious indoctrination. The first is a matter of pushing ones viewpoint. The second was a rather dumb idea in my opinion and the comments by philosopher Susan Neiman were insightful. The third is a stupid argument and was called out by Melvin Konner (who was one of the best speakers at the conference in my opinion).</li>
	<li>Joan Roughgarden - who I think was the only openly religious speaker at the conference presented a viewpoint that scientists not only have heros but also prophets. Ramachandran raised a similar point where the law of natural selection could become a dogma - suppose you find a group of human beings in some remote jungle with a cow sticking out of their abdomens, you could just say that it was natural selection and given enough time and conditions, anything like that could happen totally ignoring the possibility that there might be another cause. He expressed it more cogently but that's the gist of it .</li>
	<li>Sam Harris - Arguably the most eloquent speaker at the conference who started off with a demand for intellectual honesty and blatantly violated his own conditions by considering reincarnation and other <em>nonsensical </em>(in Lawrence Krauss' words) ideas as fields of rational inquiry because of spooky stories and lack of time to sift through the evidence supporting them. He was called out by by Melvin Konner and more stridently by Scott Atran (the debates are worth a watch). I found him remarkably inconsistent unlike Dawkins who was a lot more cogent.</li>
	<li>Steven Weinberg - So so. I found the comments on Al Ghazali errant since he was one of the thinkers who actually balanced Islamic theology with Greek philosphy rather than abolish science as a whole. Neil Tyson made a similar comment.</li>
	<li>Scott Atran - Probably the only person who actually had and presented emperical data on the behaviour of religious groups (notably <em>terrorists</em>) and results of studies that tried to find out what motivated them. Some of his insights were quite interesting.</li>
	<li>Melvin Konner - This was one of the most interesting presentations. He talked about the larger aspects of religion as a social construct and about various faith groups. He panned Harris and Dawkins rather sharply.</li>
	<li>Paul Davies - This was interesting since it stood out of the whole conference. He elevated the debate and presented the possibility of whether the Universe could have an causal explanation within itself rather than outside it.</li>
</ol>
Being of a religious bent myself, I disagree with people like Dawkins and Harris. However,  Dawkins is a lot more sincere to his positions and openly states them. Harris often prevaricates rather eloquently. Both of them however have bad reasons for what they state as expounded by Konner and Atran.
The whole series is worth a watch if you're interested the whole idea. The site linked to above has the videos.
