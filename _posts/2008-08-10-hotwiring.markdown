Okay. Not really <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotwiring">hotwiring</a> but still breaking into a car. I locked myself out of my car today while going out for supper. Of course I had a spare key. Where was it? In my house. Where are my house keys? On my key chain. Where's my key chain? In my car. So, I was locked out completely. I tried a couple of things but thanks to lack of any cord or string of any kind, I couldn't get very far. I called the Hyundai helpline and he suggested that I use an improvised <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slim_Jim_(lock_pick)">slim jim</a> to unlock the door. He also suggested that the closest thing I might have is my front number plate. I whipped out the <a href="http://www.swissknifeshop.co.uk/victorinox_huntsman_lite.html">same thing</a> that helped me <a href="http://nibrahim.net.in/journal/?p=140">last time I was in such a situation</a> and unscrewed the number plate. A neighbour, the house caretaker and I tried our luck for a while and after 3 or 4 tries, the caretaker succeeded and the driver door was opened. 45 minutes and no damages. Pretty cool. 

I think it's a skill that everyone should learn.
