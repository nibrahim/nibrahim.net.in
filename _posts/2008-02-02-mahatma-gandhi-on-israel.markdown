<blockquote>Commenting on the campaign by imperial powers and Zionist groups to found Israel on Palestinian land, Gandhi wrote in his paper Harijan on Nov 26, 1938:  “My sympathies are all with the Jews. They have been the untouchables of Christianity. The parallel between their treatment by Christians and the treatment of untouchables by Hindus is very close.

“<strong>But my sympathy does not blind me to the requirements of justice.</strong> The cry for the national home for the Jews does not make much appeal to me. The sanction for it is sought in the Bible and the tenacity with which the Jews have hankered after return to Palestine. Why should they not, like other peoples of the earth, make that country their home where they are born and where they earn their livelihood?

“Palestine belongs to Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English or France to the French. It's wrong and inhuman to impose the Jews on the Arabs. What is going on in Palestine today cannot be justified by any moral code of conduct. It would be a crime against humanity to reduce the proud Arabs so that Palestine can be restored to the Jews partly or wholly as their national home.  The nobler course would be to insist on a just treatment of the Jews wherever they are born and bred.”</blockquote>

Emphasis above is mine. I think that's a strong position to take. To not let one's sympathy or mercy completely cloud ones sense of justice. All this stuff confirms the idea that there can never be a perfect set of rules. There can only be a perfect man because it's the human element that can achieve the proper balance between sometimes conflicting virtues.
