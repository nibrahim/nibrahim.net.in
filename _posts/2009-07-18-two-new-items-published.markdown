I have put my nascent steampunk shooter game online at github. The URL is <a href="http://github.com/nibrahim/Xenon-Retroblast/tree/master">http://github.com/nibrahim/Xenon-Retroblast/tree/master</a> if you want to try it out. You'd need Python and PyGame (plus their dependencies). I haven't tried it on windows yet. Most of the work has been done on the trajectory and weapons so the rest of the code needs a lot more polish. But it's starting to <em>look</em> right. 

I have also put online a python tutorial I spent a few days on as part of a training I had to take here. It's available at <a href="http://nibrahim.net.in/self-defence/">http://nibrahim.net.in/self-defence/</a> if you're interested. Comments and feedback welcome.
